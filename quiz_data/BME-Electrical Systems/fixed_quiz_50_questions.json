        "Power quality analyzers help diagnose disturbances and inefficiencies by measuring key electrical parameters. These include harmonic distortion and unbalanced loads.",
        "Overload relays monitor current and protect motors from overheating due to overcurrent. They trip the circuit if the current exceeds a preset level for a certain time.",
        "Short-circuit current is the large surge of current that occurs when two conductors at different potentials touch. It must be interrupted quickly to avoid system damage.",
        "Color coding helps distinguish between live, neutral, and earth wires, reducing wiring mistakes. It enhances maintenance safety and compliance with standards.",
        "Isolator switches manually disconnect parts of an electrical system for servicing. They are typically operated when no current is flowing to ensure safety.",
        "Metering panels measure parameters like energy usage, voltage, and current. They are crucial for billing and system monitoring in commercial and residential buildings.",
        "Time-delay fuses tolerate temporary overcurrents such as motor startup without blowing. They still protect against sustained overcurrent and short circuits.",
        "An earthing conductor ensures that fault currents are safely conducted to the ground. This protects both people and equipment from electric shock and fire hazards.",
        "Inductive loads like motors and transformers consume reactive power, causing the current to lag behind voltage. This results in a lagging power factor.",
        "Harmonic filters eliminate unwanted frequencies caused by non-linear loads. They help maintain power quality and prevent overheating of components.",
        "Distribution boards split electrical supply into circuits, each protected by circuit breakers or fuses. This provides safe and organized power distribution in buildings.",
        "A short circuit occurs when there is a low-resistance path between conductors, causing excessive current. It must be interrupted quickly to avoid damage.",
        "A UPS supplies emergency power to devices during grid outages, allowing time to shut them down safely. It also conditions voltage fluctuations.",
        "European three-phase systems typically use 400V line-to-line voltage. This supports higher power loads in commercial and industrial buildings.",
        "The diversity factor accounts for the likelihood that not all connected loads operate at once. This helps optimize the size of electrical infrastructure.",
        "kWh meters measure the total amount of electrical energy consumed. This is the basis for utility billing in homes and businesses.",
        "Flickering is often caused by unstable voltage or poor connections in the circuit. It can indicate wiring faults or overloads.",
        "Energy audits analyze energy usage to identify inefficiencies and suggest improvements. They are essential for reducing consumption and costs."
