        "Earthing systems safely direct fault currents into the ground, protecting people and equipment from electric shock. It is a fundamental part of any safe electrical installation.",
        "Circuit breakers protect wiring and equipment by automatically disconnecting power when an overcurrent or short circuit is detected. This helps prevent fires and damage.",
        "XLPE (cross-linked polyethylene) cables are ideal for underground systems due to their moisture resistance and thermal stability. They are widely used in modern electrical distribution.",
        "Busbars act as centralized conductors that distribute power to multiple circuits within a distribution board. They are essential for efficient, compact power distribution.",
        "In most European countries, the standard single-phase voltage supply is 230V at 50 Hz. This is suitable for residential and small appliance use."
