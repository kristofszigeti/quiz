    "hints": [
        "Three-phase systems deliver power more efficiently and maintain a constant power level, reducing vibrations in motors and increasing performance. This makes them ideal for balanced and stable energy distribution in buildings.",
        "The MD board manages overvoltage protection, phase compensation, and initiates the main distribution lines. It serves as the hub for safely distributing power throughout a building.",
        "Capacitors provide leading reactive power that cancels the lagging reactive power from inductive devices. This improves the power factor and reduces losses in the electrical system.",
        "An RCD detects imbalance between phase and neutral currents, indicating possible leakage to earth. It rapidly disconnects the circuit, preventing electric shock hazards.",
        "Transformers use electromagnetic induction to step voltage up or down between circuits. This is essential for efficient long-distance power transmission and local distribution."
