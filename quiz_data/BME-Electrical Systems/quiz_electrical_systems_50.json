    ],
    "choices": [
        [
            "It requires more wires than single-phase systems",
            "It offers constant power delivery and efficiency",
            "It reduces the voltage for all equipment",
            "It eliminates the need for grounding"

    "answer": [
        2
    ],
    "hints": [
        "Three-phase systems deliver power more efficiently and maintain a constant power level, reducing vibrations in motors and increasing performance. This makes them ideal for balanced and stable energy distribution in buildings."
