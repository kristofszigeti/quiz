        "Three-phase systems deliver power more efficiently and maintain a constant power level, reducing vibrations in motors and increasing performance. This makes them ideal for balanced and stable energy distribution in buildings.",
        "The MD board manages overvoltage protection, phase compensation, and initiates the main distribution lines. It serves as the hub for safely distributing power throughout a building.",
        "Capacitors provide leading reactive power that cancels the lagging reactive power from inductive devices. This improves the power factor and reduces losses in the electrical system.",
        "An RCD detects imbalance between phase and neutral currents, indicating possible leakage to earth. It rapidly disconnects the circuit, preventing electric shock hazards.",
        "Transformers use electromagnetic induction to step voltage up or down between circuits. This is essential for efficient long-distance power transmission and local distribution.",
        "Single-line diagrams use simplified notation to represent entire electrical systems using one line per phase. They are crucial for planning, analysis, and fault diagnosis.",
        "A layout drawing provides spatial information on the placement of electrical elements like cables and outlets. It helps ensure practical installation and maintenance.",
        "Overvoltage protection devices absorb or redirect excess voltage caused by lightning or switching. They prevent damage to sensitive equipment and ensure safety.",
        "Contactors are electromagnetically operated switches designed to control large currents. They are often used in industrial systems to manage motors and lighting loads remotely.",
        "Inductive loads such as motors and transformers draw lagging reactive power. Compensating this with capacitors helps improve efficiency and reduce utility charges."
