        "Block diagrams use geometric shapes and lines to represent different subsystems and how they interconnect. They provide a simplified overview of system architecture.",
        "A circuit diagram provides the most detailed representation of electrical connections using standardized symbols. It is essential for installation and troubleshooting.",
        "Real power, measured in watts, is the portion of power that actually performs useful tasks like lighting or running motors. It is calculated using P = UIcos(φ).",
        "Inductive loads such as motors and transformers consume reactive power, lowering the system’s power factor. Compensation using capacitors helps to improve efficiency.",
        "Individual compensation corrects the power factor at the point of load, which is especially useful for large inductive devices. This reduces unnecessary reactive power flow in the distribution lines."
