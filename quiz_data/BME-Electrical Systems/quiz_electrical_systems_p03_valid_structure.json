        "Block diagrams simplify system representation using geometric shapes and lines to depict connections. This helps in visualizing the interaction between different subsystems.",
        "Circuit diagrams are detailed technical representations showing electrical connections using standard symbols. They are essential for system installation and maintenance.",
        "Real power is the effective power used to perform work in AC circuits and is calculated using P = UIcos(φ). It measures the energy converted into heat, light, or mechanical motion.",
        "Inductive loads such as motors and transformers consume reactive power, leading to a poor power factor. Capacitor banks are commonly used to compensate for this reactive demand.",
        "Central compensation manages reactive power at the main distribution point of a building. It provides an efficient way to improve power factor for the whole facility.",
        "Single-line diagrams simplify the representation of complex three-phase systems using a single line per circuit. This is common in high-level planning and documentation.",
        "Installation plans indicate the spatial placement of equipment like panels, lights, and sockets within a building. They are crucial for on-site work and spatial coordination.",
        "Contactors are used to remotely control high-current devices like elevator motors. They are durable and suitable for frequent switching applications.",
        "Reactive power does not perform work but is essential for maintaining voltage levels in inductive loads. It flows back and forth between the source and the reactive components.",
        "Parallel-connected capacitors provide continuous compensation to the circuit without being affected by load fluctuations. This configuration is preferred in many industrial setups."
